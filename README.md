The program is made in IDLE python 3.12, since its my main programming language.
The .txt file is required only for displaying your modifiers as you change them in the .txt file, the ones in there were made for my modified paladin, so there is a small chance that anyone else would be able to use the exact same ones, other than that, you are free to modify the content of the .txt :3
Program is in polish, since im polish, might work on an english version if im bored.
